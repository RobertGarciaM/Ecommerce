Future improvements

There are some features that will help us in the future to make our application perform better and have a better structure, for example:

* Adding pagination to queries.
* Optimize queries by creating sql indexes (Analyze in the creation of each index if it gives us better performance or on the contrary does not improve).
* Add cache to avoid unnecessary database queries.
* Add Automaper and DTOs for data transfer.
* Contain the application to scale it in a better way.
* Add unit tests.
* CI/CD
